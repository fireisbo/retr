      Mendeley   Duplicate finding algorithm
      Overview
      Find candidate records by searching the "title" as keywords.
Generally this returns matching titles in the first 20 (maximum examined) results.  If the user also specified a pmid, or DOI then match on those.  Return
the list of matching results, and total the readers of each 'version' of that title.

        Step 2
        Look at the results for matching pmid, if specified. Save the matching results.
      
      
        Step 3
        Look at the results for matching DOI, if specified. Save the matching results.
      
      
        Step 4
        Add the count of the readers of all matching results.
