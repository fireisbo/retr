These scripts provide a background processing
facility for the mendeley dup finder.
1) a pipe separated file of format
Title|Author|doi|pmid
is deposited by the user interface into the input directory.
2) the cron script (runmen.sh) runs at desired interval (every hour)
checking for files in the input directory.  Finding one or more files,
the oldest file in the input directory is selected for processing, and  
moving it to the work directory, creating a lock file in that directory
and executing backproc.sh in the background with the selected file
as argument.  this script,backproc.sh, might
run for a seemingling long time (hours) , as we can only do small amounts of work
every hour -- roughly only 20 records per hour are processed because of
mendeley throttling constraints.
while this file exists in the work directory, no other job will be selected
from the input directory.

3) when backproc.sh finishes, the output file and the input file are moved to
the output directory, the given email address is sent the output file,
and the lock is removed from the work directory.


The input file is not modified, and the output file is available on the
web from the output directory.
